# Storage for the databases.
# For better performance, it is expected that
# we are provided with two different volumes
# backed by different persistent disks (and controllers ?).
# Keeping the database files together with the same volume
# where logging is done along with writing other artifact objects
# may impact performance of the system.
#
# For regular use, one can provide the same storage class as
# that for the regular storage (See above).
#
# Possible `storageClassName` values:
#   - local-storage
#   - manual
#   - null
#   - fast (Provided by the provider)
